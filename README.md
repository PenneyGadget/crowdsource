# Crowdsource

A real time voting application built with Express.js and Socket.IO

Tired of those annoying group texts when trying to figure out something important? Create a live poll instead with Crowdsource! Choose to set a time limit or not, you can turn the poll off at any time. Share the live results as they rack up with all participants, or keep them hidden, it's up to you.
